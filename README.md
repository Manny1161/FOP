This unit aims at equipping students with the ability to write programs as part of managing large volumes of data. Topics include: data representation, control structures, working with files, algorithm design, submodules, introductory Object Oriented programming, validation, workflows and reproducibility of results. These will be discussed in the context of the Python programming language working a Linux operating environment. Students will explore oral, written and diagrammatic ways to present and communicate their designs, code and investigations. Academic Integrity will be expected to be demonstrated in all aspects of the unit.
